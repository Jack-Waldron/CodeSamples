For One in a Krillion, one of my responsibilities was developing and iterating upon the Hookshot ability, which pulls the player to a targeted enemy’s position. When the project’s combat system received a major rework, I changed this ability’s mechanics to support manual targeting in addition to its automatic system. 

The C# code within this sample, in addition to showcasing the Hookshot ability’s core implementation, describes the revised logic that supports both automatic and manual enemy targeting. 
- AimHookshot.cs contains the ability’s targeting logic
- KrillHookshot.cs contains the logic for the entity’s active behaviors
