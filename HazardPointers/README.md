For this project, I created a multithreaded self-sorting vector container in C++. To make it lock-free, I utilized the “hazard pointers” concept in my work. This involves storing the data of discarded elements within a retired pointers list, ensuring that other threads currently accessing the element can continue to do so safely.

The header file of this sample contains the full implementation of the LFSV (lock-free sorted vector) class, which also includes the implementation of the structures I used to facilitate the hazard pointers concept. One of these structures is a central memory bank to handle element data instantiation for the vector.
